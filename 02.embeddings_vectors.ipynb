    "# 2. Vectors and embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is a step-by-step guide to processing documents and creating vector representations (embeddings) of their content. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Load the Document**: It starts by loading a document (e.g., a PDF file) into the program.\n",
    "2) **Split the Document**: The document is then split into smaller chunks to make it easier to process.\n",
    "3) **Create Embeddings**: For each chunk, the notebook uses a model to create a vector representation (embedding). This is like converting the text into a series of numbers that capture its meaning.\n",
    "4) **Store the Embeddings**: These embeddings are stored in a special database called a vector store. This allows for efficient searching and retrieval based on the content of the documents.\n",
    "5) **Query the Vector Store**: Finally, the notebook demonstrates how to query this vector store to find relevant document chunks based on a search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the notebook shows how to transform text documents into a format that can be easily searched and analyzed using machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Qdrant\n",
    "Qdrant is a high-performance vector database used to store and search vector representations (embeddings) of data efficiently. It is scalable and integrates well with machine learning and AI applications, making it suitable for production environments."
