    "# 10. Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "A reasoning framework in LangChain refers to the logical approach or methodology an agent uses to :\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Analyze a user’s input, \n",
    "2) Plan its actions, \n",
    "3) And decide how to solve the task by selecting and using tools or models. \n",
    "\n",
    "It defines how the agent **“thinks”**, **reasons** about the problem, and executes steps to reach the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example is “React” (Reason + Act) Framework. The React framework is a common reasoning framework in LangChain. Here’s how it works:\n",
    "1.\t**Reason**: The agent thinks about the task and decides what to do next.\n",
    "2.\t**Act**: The agent executes the chosen action (e.g., calling a tool or querying a model).\n",
    "3.\t**Repeat**: The agent evaluates the result and decides the next step, iterating as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides several agent types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **zero-shot-react-description**: General-purpose, dynamically selects tools based on input reasoning.\n",
    "- **conversational-react-description**: Context-aware for maintaining conversational history.\n",
    "- **self-ask-with-search**: Breaks queries into sub-questions for iterative reasoning and retrieval.\n",
    "- **plan-and-execute**: Separates planning and execution into distinct phases for structured workflows.\n",
    "- **openai-functions**: Leverages OpenAI’s function-calling capabilities for dynamic tool invocation.\n",
    "- **react-chain**: Implements step-by-step reasoning and action workflows but can be limited in complex scenarios.\n",
    "- **reflection/reflextion**: Evaluates and iterates on outputs, improving results over multiple attempts through self-reflection.\n",
    "- **rew00**: Modular agent focusing on reasoning, execution, observation, and optimization to refine outcomes dynamically.\n",
    "- **toolkit**: Works with predefined toolsets for tightly integrated and specialized tasks.\n",
    "- **custom agents**: Fully customizable agents tailored to unique domain-specific needs.\n"

      "/tmp/ipykernel_812376/3691470614.py:24: LangChainDeprecationWarning: LangChain agents will continue to be supported, but it is recommended for new use cases to be built with LangGraph. LangGraph offers a more flexible and full-featured framework for building agents, including support for tool-calling, persistence of state, and human-in-the-loop workflows. For details, refer to the `LangGraph documentation <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/>`_ as well as guides for `Migrating from AgentExecutor <https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/migrate_agent/>`_ and LangGraph's `Pre-built ReAct agent <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/create-react-agent/>`_.\n",
